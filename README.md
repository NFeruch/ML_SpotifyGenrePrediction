# MachineLearning-SpotifyGenrePrediction

Machine learning classification take-home project for an interview with [Thrasio](https://www.thrasio.com/), a mass Amazon FBA Buyer

### Background:
* `Spotify has an internal tool that gives songs various attributes like dancibility, loudness, popularity, etc.`
* `Given a dataset of songs with these attributes, we are interested in predicting the genre of the song.`
* `Accuracy was the most important metric to take into consideration`

### In the Notebook:
1) `EDA and Feature Engineering`
2) `Model training and hyper-parameter tuning`
3) `Model accuracy interpretation`

I utilized the **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** for classification
